# Pet-Match 
Project on Human Computer Interaction that studies how users would respond to a well-made, user friendly website for pet adoption.

This project focuses on creating an easy-to-navigate frontend website through the step-by-step process of design thinking. Our Pet Match website was the result of 5 stages:
1. **Ideation** with the Lotus Blossom technique
2. **Discovering Requirements** through questionnaire and interviews
3. **Data Analyzing and Presentation Finding** using use case diagram
4. **Prototyping** in Figma
5. **Evaluation and Solution** from the reviews of our users

Our website consists of 10 pages with multiple features which allows users to:
- find suitable pets for adoption that can be filtered based on species or location
- read latest articles about pet health, diet plans, etc.
- find pet services such as shelters, vets, etc.

_This website was created as a group project for BINUS University's Human Computer Interaction course and is not officially hosted_
